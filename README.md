# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 🔍 Overview

This project features a Power BI dashboard that analyzes electric vehicle (EV) distribution and performance across the United States. It provides actionable insights into total vehicle counts, average range, manufacturer trends, and eligibility classifications based on various filters.

## 🛠 Setup

* Tool: Power BI Desktop
* Dataset Source: U.S. EV registration dataset 
## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

* **Total Vehicles**: 150.42K
* **Average Vehicle Range**: 67.83 miles

## 📌 Key Visualizations

1. **Total Vehicles by Model Year**

   * Line chart showing the adoption trend of EVs from 2010 to 2024.
   * Sharp rise observed post-2018 indicating accelerated adoption.

2. **Total Vehicles by Make**

   * Breakdown of top manufacturers (e.g., Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, etc.).
   * Tesla leads with 69K vehicles.

3. **EV Type Distribution**

   * Pie chart comparing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
   * BEVs account for 77.61% of the total.

4. **CAFV Eligibility Analysis**

   * Donut chart categorizing vehicles by Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility status.

5. **Vehicle Model Breakdown**

   * Treemap showing the most registered models (Model Y, Model 3, LEAF, etc.)

6. **Geographic Distribution (Map View)**

   * Choropleth map displaying state-wise distribution of electric vehicles across the U.S.

7. **Interactive Filters**

   * **City**
   * **Electric Utility**
   * **EV Type**
   * **Model Year**

## 📈 Insights

* Tier-1 cities show high adoption but Tier-2 and Tier-3 areas are rapidly catching up.
* Tesla dominates the market both in model and make.
* Eligibility for CAFV programs is a key factor affecting distribution patterns.
